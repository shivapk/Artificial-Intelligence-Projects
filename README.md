# Artificial-Intelligence (CSCE 625)
Languages used: C++, Prolog, Java.
About Projects in Brief: Heuristic search procedures for general graphs, game playing strategies, resolution and rule based deduction systems, knowledge representation, reasoning with uncertainty.

Objectives:
1. To learn about intelligent search methods and their role in building complex problem-solving programs.
                 -> to learn how to formulate computational problems as search
                 -> to learn how various search algorithms work
                 -> to learn their computational properties (space- and time-complexity)
                 -> to learn how heuristics can improve efficiency of search
2. To learn about knowledge representation techniques and methods for knowledge-based/intelligent decision-making in programs.
                 -> to learn syntax and semantics of propositional logic and first-order logic
                 -> to learn how inference algorithms work
                 -> to learn the advantages of alternative knowledge respresentation systems
                 -> to learn how to represent and reason about uncertainty using Bayesian probability
3. To gain exposure to automated deduction, planning.
                 -> to learn how symbolic planning algorithms work
                 -> to learn different decision-making architectures for intelligent agents
                 -> to learn how machine learning can be used to generalize from experience/examples
