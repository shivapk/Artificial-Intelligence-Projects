The overall goal of this project is to implement A* search and use it to solve a classic AI search
problem: the "Blocksworld". This problem involves stacking blocks into a target configuration. You are to write a program to solve random instances of this problem using your own implementation of A* search. The focus of the project, however, is to use our intuition to develop a heuristic that will make solving various instances of this problem more effectively and solve them in fewer iterations.

This task involves stacking blocks. The blocks are labeled by integers. Both the Number of Blocks and Stacks are parameters.
