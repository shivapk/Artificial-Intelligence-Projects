This Project uses Prolog, which will rely on your understanding of back-chaining and unification. The questions represent different types of use
cases for Prolog, from database-like queries, to knowledge representation (concept definitions), to numerical computations, to decision-making and problem-solving.
I recommend you use SWI Prolog (www.swi-prolog.org). 

Some main aspects of this project include Decision-making rules in Prolog for:
 -> Wumpus World. 
 -> Tic-Tac-Toe
 -> 4 Queens Problem
 -> Factorization
 -> Kinship relationships
